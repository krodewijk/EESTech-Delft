# Introduction
> The media is really, the word, one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with, is 'fake,'. I guess other people have used it perhaps over the years but I've never noticed it. And it's a shame. And they really hurt the country. Because they take away the spirit of the country.
Donald Trump

Setting aside the claim of Donald Trump inventing the term Fake News, the subject is becoming very relevant today. A research has found that 49% of social media users spots fake news at least once a day. The rise of Fake News is a fact. However, the statistics are hard to find since social media networks contain an enormous amount of data. This is a perfect example of a Big Data problem.

Take for example Twitter. Twitter has, at the time of this writing, 313 million active users generating around 500 million tweets every day! That is a lot of data to analyse. Facebook is an even bigger platform with over 1280 million active users.

Both platforms have their own developed API with efficient search engines for keywords or hashtags. This makes analysing the data a bit easier.

## Problems or Objectives
Social Media is a Big Data source alone. Not only the fake news controversy is a problem. Other statistics can be found from this network.

### Fake news
As mentioned in the introduction, fake news is becoming a problem, but there are no statistics to show for it. The hardest part is classifying news as fake. Using API's of social media it is possible to search for keywords used in known trending fake news for example. It might be even be possible to create a classification machine to detect the fake news.

### Correlations
Correlations are always fun to find. For example the correlation between an event and a hashtag. It is obvious that the hashtag #sick is increasing during a flu epidemic. Social Media API and API's of News platforms can be used to find these correlations or trending lines.

### Network maps
Social Media have a lot of Users. It might be possible to find some fun statistics of these users. Some patterns of a nice graphic could be created to show certain connections between groups of people for instance.
