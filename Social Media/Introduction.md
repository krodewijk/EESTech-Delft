# Introduction
> The media is really, the word, one of the greatest of all terms I've come up with, is 'fake,'. I guess other people have used it perhaps over the years but I've never noticed it. And it's a shame. And they really hurt the country. Because they take away the spirit of the country.
- Donald Trump

Setting aside the claim of Donald Trump inventing the term Fake News, the subject is becoming very relevant today. A research has found that 49% of social media users spots fake news at least once a day. The rise of Fake News is a fact. However, the statistics are hard to find since social media networks contain an enormous amount of data. This is a perfect example of a Big Data problem.

Take for example Twitter. Twitter has, at the time of this writing, 313 million active users generating around 500 million tweets every day! That is a lot of data to analyse. Facebook is an even bigger platform with over 1280 million active users.

Both platforms have their own developed API with efficient search engines for keywords or hashtags. This makes analysing the data a bit easier.
