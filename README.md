# EESTech-Delft
Repository for the EESTech Challenge preliminary round in Delft.

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for the EESTech Challenge preliminary round in Delft. On the day of the EESTech Challenge, you'll be working on a own-made tool for processing big data for different subjects which are free to choose. The day will last from 10:00 to 17:00 on a Saturday 13 January 2018. The day will start with a small pitch lecture of a professor at the TU Delft specialized in Big Data. After this introduction, the programming session will start. During lunch break, the comity will provide with food and drinks. In the end, all of the results will be presented by groups and after a short judging moment, the winner will be selected. After the winner announcement, the group will go to Delft for some drinks.

## Participants
The teams will consist of 2 to 4 persons. Of course, some knowledge on programming is recommended. The programming language or the tools are free to choose from with the exception of programs not freely available for the TU Students (MATLAB is available!). The Objectives or Problems are free to choose from as well. For each category, some example objectives are given. The overall objective is to create a creative tool for an open data set. The presentations are free to be given. Powerpoint or Posters are allowed during the presentation. A demonstration of the tool would be a good thing. The tools and presentations will be judged for ingenuity and creativity.

## Prize
The best tool will of course receive a prize. The winning team will be going to the Finals of the EESTech Challenge somewhere in Europe. The housing and basic needs will be provided during the 4 days of this final event. For the traveling cost, every ETV member can receive up to â‚¬100,- per year.
