# Introduction Energy
Energy is needed to accomplish anything. No wonder that the biggest man made structure ever is the electrical power grid. This grid is enormous so, naturally, a lot of data can be extraced from this network. This introduction gives you a headstart by already giving some ideas over the implementation of big data techniques on the energy subject.

## Ideas
### Visualisation
Visualisation is an ever returning subject in big data. No human is capable of understanding so much data, so visualisation is vital in representing the data in a way that is humanly understandeble. 
Easy-to-understand maps of Europe or the US can be made with all the power plants listed with (for example) their corresponding power output. Or a map can be made with  the focus on renewable energy and temperature for example. A lot is possible here, so be creative!

### Predictions
The current energy grid is far from perfect. A lot of waste still happens not only at the energy consuming side but also at the supply side. This is mainly because of generation and transmission inefficiencies. 
Simulate an existing area with different power plants (coal, solar, wind, etc.) at different location with as goal to create a sigificantly higher overall efficiency of the grid. 

### Renewable energy
Fortunately renewable energy is getter more significant in the energy world. No more fossil fuel plants, but solar, wind and hydro. 
A lot of ideas are possible with big data focussed on renewable energy. Some are:
* Recreate an existing energy grid, but instead of fossil fuel plans, use only renewable energy plants.
* What is the current situation with respect to renewable energy?
